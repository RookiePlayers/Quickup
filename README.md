## Introduction
one command to spin up a whole dev workspace for new teammates. Here's a pragmatic, cross-OS friendly approach that works on macOS, Linux, and WSL. It's interactive, handles "x" repos, verifies/installs prerequisites (Docker, Make, Git), and then lets the user pick which project to make up.

## Quick start
Clone this repo then run the following:

```bash
# Make it executable and run it:
chmod +x setup_workspace.sh
./setup_workspace.sh
```
